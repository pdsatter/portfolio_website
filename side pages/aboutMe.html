        <p>
            I am a computer science major at the University of Houston with a GPA of 3.73.  I graduated Katy High School with a GPA of 4.0.  I did wrestling and high school and was a varsity
            wrestler on the KHS wrestling team.  I learned programming mostly on my own, so I am mostly self taught.  I enjoy learning a lot and I want to get better at something every day.  
            Some things I do in my free time are gaming, going to the gym, skateboarding, and hanging out with my friends.  I also program for fun, but mainly if I'm not too busy with 
            school, work, and my personal life.  I also have a dog named Litsa, and she is my child.  My family saved her from being euthanized because she was so skinny as a puppy.
            Now she is a cornerstone in my family.
